# Reversed Connection Scam Algorithm

Custom Implementation of the [Connection Scan Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05997) for the final project of the 2021 Lab in Data Science class at EPFL. This aim of this project was to build a robust SBB journey planner for the ZÃ¼rich area: given departure and arrival stops and a desired arrival time, the fastest journey must be found.

I designed a reversed implementation of the algorithm to deal with this reversed problem (desired arrival time instead of desired start time).
